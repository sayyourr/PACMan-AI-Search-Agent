# 🧠 Pacman AI Search Project

This project is part of an Artificial Intelligence course (based on UC Berkeley CS188) that explores various search strategies in a Pacman environment. You’ll implement intelligent agents that find paths through mazes to collect food efficiently using different algorithms like BFS, UCS, and A\* with heuristics.

## 📁 Files Overview

All code files should be placed in the same directory (e.g., search/). Key files:

- pacman.py – Game starter
- search.py – Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*)
- searchAgents.py – Your agent & heuristic implementations
- game.py – Game engine
- util.py – Useful data structures like Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue
- layouts/ – Folder containing maps (e.g., bigSearch.lay)

## 🚀 Run the Game

Navigate to the project directory and use the following command structure:

```bash
python pacman.py -l <layout> -p <agent> -z <zoom>
